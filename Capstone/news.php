              Mohammed Siraj got India's first breakthrough with Dom Sibley's
              wicket
            </h3>
            <p class="sectiontext">
              One of the ways India beat Australia earlier this year was by
              cutting out their scoring options on the off side, they did this
              by subverting the traditional off-stump attacking line.This wasn’t
              the first time Siraj showed his happy knack of making things
              happen with the ball in hand. In the six Tests he had played
              before this one, the 27-year-old provided a number of similar
              moments of inspiration. He got wickets when his team needed it the
              most.

              Aaron Finch in race to be fit for T20 World Cup after successful
              knee surgery.
            </h3>
            <p class="sectiontext">
              Australia's limited-overs captain Aaron Finch has undergone knee
              surgery with the recovery expected to take eight to 10 weeks as he
              aims to be fit for the T20 World Cup. Finch missed the recent
              Bangladesh tour having suffered cartilage damage ahead of the
              series in West Indies. He managed to play the five T20Is in the
              Caribbean but aggravated the injury in the final game.

              'I thought I might never play for England again' - Ollie Robinson
            </h3>
            <p class="sectiontext">
              "It was tough. Probably the toughest few weeks I've had in cricket
              to be honest, or in my life, actually. It affected not only myself
              but my family. But luckily it all came good today."He had taken
              his first Test five-fer in only his second match – but Ollie
              Robinson, suspended after the discovery of offensive tweets he
              posted nine years ago, admitted that in June he feared his England
              career was over.

            <p class="sectiontext">
              Rahul looked assured at the other end, with his combination of
              soft hands and patience carrying on from the Nottingham Test. He
              ground it out while Rohit kept the scoring rate healthy, only
              opening up once he had lost his opening partner. In trademark
              style, this acceleration involved jumping down to England's spin
              option Moeen Ali and launching him back over his head, before
              bringing out a variety of punches - front and back foot - square
              on the off side.

              Joe Root's flawless 180* helps England edge 27 ahead
            </h3>
            <p class="sectiontext">
              Joe Root made his fourth century at Lord's, and stretched it past
              150 like he had the first three times, as a near-perfect display
              on Day 3 helped England take a slender lead against India. He was
              left stranded on 180 with England being bowled out off the last
              ball of the day. The 27-run lead capped off a gradual comeback
              from England in the match, which had begun by first bowling India
              out early on Day 2 and then battling through to stumps on a
              difficult evening. Exactly two days and two innings now remain for
              the teams to force a result.

              few plot twists in it. Pakistan still have half their side left,
              including - crucially - captain Babar Azam on 54 as they try and
              stretch out a relatively vulnerable 124-run lead beyond the
              capacity of the hosts in what should be an engrossing fourth
              innings chase.

              in past campaigns we lost in the semi-finals and finals. I never

              The overwhelming sentiment from India's players of the day was
              that the World Cup win was a victory for the nation and not just
              themselves.It’s been 10yrs since Team India won the @icc CWC. Most
              definitely one of my career highlights. I’m so proud to see how
              the team has grown from that day & how the players have developed
              since. Thank you @incredibleindia for all the wonderful memories.

              this 822-frames-per-second video of a knuckleball on loop, from
